# What's LS?
LS is a lightweight frontend framework designed for both full UI/UX development and general-purpose utilities. It is one of the most light-weight while powerful and full-featured frameworks out there!<br>
It is one of the few frameworks that won't hog 20x more RAM than it should and flood your website with all that unnecessary bloat causing it to get slow *(ahem, MS Teams)*.<br>

It‚Äôs lightweight, efficient, and as easy to use as any standard library‚Äîjust two files and you‚Äôre set. Components can be tree-shaken via the URL so you only load what you need.<br> 

- ü¶é **Versatile**
    - We have used it for things starting from simple landing pages to entire complex interfaces (eg. our [video editor](https://github.com/the-lstv/VideoEditor)) - thanks to that, we have rich experience using LS for wildly different specific scenarios, which helped shape LS into a highly flexible framework that fits pretty much with anything.

- üêú **Light and simple**
    - This has always been the main goal of LS from even its earliest days. We were tired of the bulky mess that is the majority of today's frameworks, and wanted to create something that just does its job properly.
    - LS is designed to be as easy to use as it possibly can. No need to rewrite the kernel and reinvent physics just to style a button.
    - LS tries its best not to conflict with anything else, respecting your usage patterns and other libraies.

- :godmode: **Powerful.**
    - It really is - being mature for over half a decade, undergoing multiple renovations, it is robust, fast, and does not lack in features.

- üì¶ **No dependencies**
    - That's right: LS is fully self-contained and uses almost no 3rd party code, meaning that you don't need anything extra to get the full set of features that LS has.

- ‚ú® **Honest and clean code**
    - Every part of LS is written from scratch, purpose-built for efficiency. Many frameworks rely on random third-party libraries out of convenience. We don‚Äôt. LS is built entirely in-house, with optimized, handcrafted implementations that achieve more in fewer lines of code, without sacrificing functionality.
    - To be fully transparent: there is _one_ external piece of code, that being normalize.css bundled with the CSS core, to to maintain standardized defaults.

- üí™ **Open-Source**
    - Licensed under GPL v3.0!


Don't believe me? [See it in action]() (actually not, v5.1.0 is not in production yet, sorry - very soon!) - all of our platforms use it. Just take a look at the lack of bloat and feel some of those snappy interfaces yourself.
<br>


## LS v5.1.0
v5 is by far the largest update ever released to LS.<br>
### What's new?
- ‚ú® New, modern API remade from scratch
- üìî New, better component system
- ü´ß Insanely efficient and light reactivity system
- üöÄ Significantly improved performance all around
- üíæ Optimized for memory efficiency
- üíº Smaller size, even more light-weight
- üíª Reworked design language, UI framework, etc.



> [!WARNING]
> If you are migrating from earlier LS versions, please review the migration notes. As this is a major release of LS, API compatibility is not guaranteed and a lot of things were changed or removed. Namely all previously deprecated methods were removed and many methods have changed.
> CSS variables and API usage has also been changed!

> [!NOTE]
> Normalize.css is now bundled with ls.css by default!

## v4 vs v5 Performance

v5 is faster and more memory efficient in various fields.

| Operation               | v4 (Ops/s)      | v5 (Ops/s)            | Speed Improvement |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **Event Handling**      |                 |                       |                   |
| Event `emit`            | 1,011,971       | 120,960,480           | ~120x faster      |
| Event `on`              | 666,207         | 4,310,638             | ~6x faster        |
| Event `once`            | 295,046         | 4,418,975             | ~14x faster       |
| **Elements selector**   |                 |                       |                   |
| Simple selector         | --              | --                    | ~4.5x faster      |
| Complex selector        | --              | --                    | ~2x faster        |

## Getting started
### With [Akeno](https://github.com/the-lstv/Akeno/)
Using LS with Akeno is the best and easiest way to do it, since Akeno comes with built-in LS support and works closely with it, making certain things easier and more clean.

 All you need to import LS is:
```html
<head>
    @use (ls:5.1.0[]);
</head>
```
And you are using LS! Components are added into the square brackets ([]) as a comma separated list - it will also automatically manage CSS/JS pairs, so you don't have to think about which part to place where! Akeno will also optimize the URL for best shared caching practices to reduce load times.<br>
 If you plan to use the design language, don't forget to specify the style (simply default to flat if you are unsure):
```html
<head>
    @use (ls:5.1.0[ flat ]);

    @page { theme: dark; style: flat; accent: blue }
</head>
```

<br>

### Without Akeno
You can add LS to your app or site easily with just two tags (or one, if you don't need either scripting or styles - it will work).<br>
API syntax (includes core): `/ls/[version]/[?components]/ls.[?min].[js|css]`<br>
Or, to only import a component without the core: `/ls/[version]/[component].[?min].[js|css]`<br>
Or, to import multiple components without the core: `/ls/[version]/[components]/bundle.[?min].[js|css]`

```html
<script src="https://cdn.extragon.cloud/ls/5.1.0/ls.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.extragon.cloud/ls/5.1.0/flat/ls.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

And you can start using LS right away!

Time to head to the docs and explore all the awesome things that LS offers!

## Hosting the API
You can use the static files in /dist/ - but if you want the same full-featured API as the official CDN (includes version management, on-the-fly code minification, and tree-shaking modules from an URL), you can!<br>
You can host your own server for the LS cdn API, for example for local development, or any other use you may have for it.<br>
The backend API code is open-source, located at /backend/api.js in this repository.<br>
To host the API, you will need [Akeno](https://github.com/the-lstv/Akeno/).
